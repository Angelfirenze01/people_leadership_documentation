# SWOT Analysis

Make a copy of this document and complete three SWOT analyses looking at three key areas:

- Personal  
- Department
- Organisation

The analysis can look at personal characteristics as well as technical items.  

Look at any Annual Operating Plan (AOP) and Target Operating Performance Plans (TOPPs) for the organisation's goals and objectives. Identify where objectives align with your own.

This analysis can help provide context for future goals and objectives, as well as training needs.

Once complete share a copy of this document with your line manager.

- Strengths: Positive aspects, things under your control, what you are good at, what value you offer.
- Weaknesses: negative aspects, things under your control, but things that can be improved.
- Opportunities: Positive external conditions, not under your control, areas in which you can take advantage.
- Threats: Negative external conditions, not under your control, but the effects of which you may be able to mitigate or reduce.
